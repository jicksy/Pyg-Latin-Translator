Pyg-Latin-Translator
====================

Pig Latin is a language game where words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules.

If the original word starts with a vowel, you append the suffix 'ay' to the end of the word.

If the original word starts with a consonant, you move the first letter of the word to the end,
and then append the suffix 'ay'.
